<h1>The Traveller Map</h1>

    <p>
      Traveller is a role-playing game set against a background drawn
      from adventure oriented science fiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the distant future, interstellar travel is as common as
      international travel is today. The tremendous distances involved
      in travel between the stars dictate that such voyages take
      weeks, months, and even years. A situation similar to Earth in
      the eighteenth century is created, where communication is
      limited to the speed of travel, and the stage is set for
      adventure in a grand fashion, with all the trappings of classic
      science fiction: giant, star-spanning empires (good, evil, or
      both), huge starfleets, wily interstellar merchants (or pirates,
      depending on your point of view), complex diplomatic maneuvers,
      larger-than-life heroes, heroines, and villains.

    <h3>About This Site</h3>

    <p>
      The map was inspired by many sources: the <a target="_blank" href="http://travellerbibliography.org/gdw-ct/knownspace.html">
      Imperium Map poster</a> which provided an overview of known space in the <b><i>Classic
      Traveller</i></b> era; the Spinward Marches poster included with <a target="_blank" href="http://travellerbibliography.org/gdw-ct/Deluxe.html">
      Deluxe Traveller</a>; and the <cite><a target="_blank" href="http://travellerbibliography.org/gdw-ct/Atlas.html">
      Atlas of the Imperium</a></cite>, which provided cursory maps of all
      sectors of the Third Imperium. Each of these sources are numbered among my
      treasured posessions from childhood. I carefully pieced together a map with all
      of the sector names from the classic Alien Modules, and meticulously traced the
      various borders onto it. (<a class="lightbox" target="_blank" href="../pictures/Big_Map_1.jpg">See it!</a>) I also
      dutifully entered the Sector Generator BASIC program into my Apple II and spent
      endless hours in the 1980s trying to coax a decent <a class="lightbox" target="_blank" href="../pictures/DotMatrix%20Amdukan.jpg">map from a 72-DPI dot-matrix
      printer</a>. (Marc, you rock.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In early 2005, after a hiatus from <b><i>Traveller</i></b> of nearly 20 years,
      I purchased a copy of the <cite><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/traveller/core/">
      GURPS Traveller</a></cite> rulebook, which includes a
      <a class="lightbox" target="_blank" href="../pictures/GURPS%20Traveller%20Map.jpg">map of charted space within the frame of an imaginary computer-based map viewer</a>. I first saw this within weeks of
      <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a>
      appearing, and was inspired to create a functional
      version of the map viewer using contemporary Web technologies. (Loren, you rock
      too.)
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many other <b><i>Traveller</i></b> map resources on the Internet.
      Some other Web-based tools make use of static images (such as <a target="_blank" href="http://jtas.net/travelleratlas/index.php">
      The Traveller Atlas</a>), which require significant preparation time by the
      site author; others use client-side technology (such as the [now offline] <!-- a href="http://www2.magmacom.com/~ehenry/traveller/" -->
      <cite>The Java SubSector Viewer</cite><!-- /a -->). There are also full applications, such as
      Jim Vassilakos' highly regarded
      <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Galactic">Galactic</a>
      and commercial applications such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.trisen.com/sol/default.asp?topic=10&amp;page=47">
      Traveller Universe</a>. This site is a supplement to these other tools; the
      impressive work by their creators cannot be understated. (They rock as well.
      I'm just standing on the shoulders of giants here.)

    <h3>How It Works</h3>

    <p>
      The map page is constructed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and
      has been tested with Internet Explorer 8+, Chrome, Firefox,
      Opera, and Safari. The page uses script to request image tiles
      from the server. As the map is dragged, any newly revealed tiles
      are requested from the server, filling in the edges of the map.
    </p>
    <p>
      The server providing the map tiles is running Microsoft's
      ASP.NET, with a custom ASPX service generating the images on the
      fly. The service is coded using C# and makes use of the GDI+
      (via <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pdfsharp.net/">PDFsharp</a>) to render
      the tiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The full source code to the site - both client and server - is
      available
      on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/inexorabletash/travellermap">GitHub</a>
      and is released under the Apache open source license.
    </p>
    <p>
      The map data comes from two sources. The macro-scale data - comprising the
      governmental borders and rifts - was literally traced from the
      <a href="http://travellerbibliography.org/gdw-ct/knownspace.html" target="_blank">Imperium Map</a>
      poster released by GDW in the early 1980s by scanning the map and tracing the
      borders with a mouse into a custom vector format. The micro-scale data is
      derived from sector data found on the Internet in
      <a href="fileformats.html">".sec" format</a>. Official
      data from the <i>Traveller 5 Second Survey</i> effort is used where available.

    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>API</h3>

    <p>
        Most of the data that allows the site to function is exposed by various APIs over
        HTTP and can be used by other sites and applications.
        See the <a href="api.html">API Documentation</a> for more details.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="notes">
    <h3>Design Notes</h3>

    <p>
      The aspect ratio of the map follows the <b><i>Classic Traveller</i></b> convention
      of hexagonal parsecs, so parsecs are cos(30&deg;):1 rather than square. This
      means that the map on this site matches the <b><i>Classic Traveller</i></b> resources
      such as the Imperium Map, maps in the Alien Modules, the Spinward Marches and
      Solomani Rim modules, and hexagonal subsector maps. The maps may appear
      distorted when compared with square-based maps such as the <cite>Atlas of the
        Imperium</cite> or <b><i>MegaTraveller</i></b>-era publications.
    </p>
    <p>
      When zoomed out to larger scales, the stars are rendered pseudo-randomly rather
      than trying to display the actual system data. This maintains the appearance of
      the Imperium Map poster. Rifts are simply left empty. At extremely large scales
      the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/images/2353-sig05-010a-Milky-Way-Bar">structure of Milky Way galaxy</a>
      is represented using an illustration by
      Robert Hurt (<a target="_blank" href="http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/">SSC</a>),
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/">JPL-Caltech</a>,
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nasa.gov/home/index.html">NASA</a>, circa 2005.
    </p>
    <p>
      The map features shown at various zoom levels are arbitrary; I settled on them
      by trial and error. Although some view toggles are exposed by the controls, most are
      hard-coded. Here is a rough guide, with scale in pixels/parsec.
